Included are 2 example bam files. These are very small random subsamplings of the same real, aligned paired end ChIP data.
Use these to verify that the pipeline is working as intended. Running the pipeline on A/A or B/B should result in a value of 1. Running the pipeline on A/B should be about -0.6, just because of what reads happened to be chosen.
